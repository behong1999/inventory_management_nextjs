# Inventory Management - INVSTOCK

This is a responsive inventory management application built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind**, **Postgres**, and various other tools and libraries to provide a smooth user experience for tracking and managing inventory. The backend is hosted on **AWS EC2**, with a scalable database on **AWS RDS**, static file storage in **AWS S3**, and the frontend deployed via **AWS Amplify**.

### How it works
- **Custom VPC**: Hosts a public and private subnet. The public subnet connects to the internet gateway, while the private subnet routes through the public subnet for secure backend access.
- **EC2 & RDS**: Backend logic runs on EC2, which interacts with the PostgreSQL database hosted on RDS in the private subnet.
- **Amplify & API Gateway**: The Next.js frontend is hosted on Amplify, which communicates with the API Gateway to send requests to the backend.
- **S3**: Users directly access static assets (e.g., images) stored in S3 through pre-signed URLs or public access configurations.

ðŸ Š Flow: Users access the frontend â†’ Amplify calls API Gateway â†’ Gateway routes requests to EC2 â†’ EC2 interacts with RDS â†’ Responses flow back to Amplify.
